========================

Hey there, future OmniMind star! 🎉 Whether you’re a developer diving into MCP (Model Context Protocol), an AI enthusiast tweaking Google Gemini-powered tools, or a solopreneur with a brilliant idea, we’d love your help making OmniMind the ultimate AI companion. Contributing is easy, fun, and a great way to join our open-source community!

Before you jump in, let’s chat about your ideas. Drop us a note via:

- An `issue on GitHub <https://github.com/Techiral/OmniMind/issues/new>`_ (use the “Feature Request” template for new ideas!).
- A quick email to `techiralthefuture@gmail.com <mailto:techiralthefuture@gmail.com>`_.
- Or ping us on `X <https://x.com/techiral_>`_ if you’re feeling social!

This keeps us all on the same page. Oh, and please check out our :ref:`code-of-conduct` below—we’re all about kindness and collaboration here.

Pull Request Process
--------------------

Ready to share your magic? Here’s how to submit a pull request (PR) like a pro:

1. **Clean Up**: Remove any extra install or build dependencies before finishing your changes—keep it lean and mean!
2. **Update the README**: If your tweak changes how OmniMind works (e.g., new MCP server options, environment variables, or cool features), add a quick note to the `README <https://github.com/Techiral/OmniMind/blob/main/README.md>`_. Think new tools, ports, or file locations—make it shine!
3. **Bump the Version**: Update version numbers in the `README <https://github.com/Techiral/OmniMind/blob/main/README.md>`_ and any `examples/ <https://github.com/Techiral/OmniMind/tree/main/examples>`_ files to match your PR. We use `SemVer <http://semver.org/>`_ (e.g., ``0.1.0`` → ``0.1.1`` for small fixes, ``0.2.0`` for new features). It’s how we keep OmniMind growing!
4. **Get the Green Light**: You’ll need two thumbs-up from other developers to merge your PR. If you can’t merge it yourself, just ask a reviewer to hit that button for you—we’ve got your back!

Your contribution could power up MCP connections, boost AI smarts, or make OmniMind even easier for everyone. Let’s do this!

Code of Conduct
---------------

Our Pledge
~~~~~~~~~~

We’re building an open, welcoming space for everyone to explore MCP, AI, and open-source goodness. As contributors and maintainers, we promise to make OmniMind a harassment-free zone for all—no matter your age, background, experience level, or identity. Everyone’s invited to the party!

Our Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here’s how we keep the vibe positive:

- Use friendly, inclusive words—think “Hey, great idea!” not “That’s dumb.”
- Respect different views and experiences—variety makes OmniMind awesome.
- Welcome feedback with a smile—it’s how we grow.
- Focus on what’s best for our community—more MCP tools, better AI, happy users!
- Show empathy—lift each other up.

What’s not cool:

- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwanted advances—keep it professional.
- Trolling, insults, or personal attacks—let’s keep the peace.
- Harassment of any kind—public or private, it’s a no-go.
- Sharing private info (like emails or addresses) without permission—privacy first!
- Anything you wouldn’t say in a friendly workplace—common sense rules.

Our Responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our maintainers are here to set the tone and keep things fair. They’ll step in if someone’s out of line—removing comments, rejecting changes, or even banning repeat offenders if needed. It’s all about keeping OmniMind a safe space to innovate with MCP and AI.

Scope
~~~~~

This Code of Conduct applies everywhere OmniMind lives—GitHub, emails, X posts, or even events where you’re repping the project. If you’re using our official channels (like `techiralthefuture@gmail.com <mailto:techiralthefuture@gmail.com>`_ or the repo), you’re part of this community!

Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~

See something off? Let us know at `techiralthefuture@gmail.com <mailto:techiralthefuture@gmail.com>`_. We’ll check it out, keep it confidential, and respond with what’s fair—whether it’s a fix, a chat, or stronger action. Maintainers who don’t follow this code will face the same rules—no exceptions.

Attribution
~~~~~~~~~~~

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the `Contributor Covenant <http://contributor-covenant.org>`_, version 1.4, available at `http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/ <http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/>`_. We’ve tweaked it to fit OmniMind’s mission of MCP-powered AI awesomeness!
