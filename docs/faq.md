## Setup Questions

### What Do I Need to Start?
Just three things:
1. **Python**: A free tool most computers have (see [installation.md](installation.md) to check or get it).
2. **Google Gemini API Key**: A free key to power the AI (instructions in [installation.md](installation.md)).
3. **A Config File**: A simple list of MCP servers (we show you how in [installation.md](installation.md)).

**Why It’s Great**: These are quick to set up, and we guide you every step—no hard stuff here!

### What If I Don’t Have Python?
No problem! Check [installation.md](installation.md)—it’s free and takes just a few clicks to install on Windows, Mac, or Linux. Even if you’ve never heard of Python, you’ll have it ready in minutes.

**Why It’s Great**: Super easy to get, and it’s all free!

### How Do I Get the Google Gemini API Key?
Head to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), sign up (it’s free to start), and grab your key. Save it with a simple command (see [installation.md](installation.md)). If you’re new, it’s like getting a library card—quick and painless!

**Why It’s Great**: Free to try, and it connects OmniMind to smart AI answers fast!

### What’s a Config File, and Why Do I Need It?
It’s a small file (like `my_config.json`) that tells OmniMind which MCP servers to use—think of it as a list of helpers. You can copy ours from [installation.md](installation.md) and tweak it. It’s needed because OmniMind talks to these servers to do cool things like fetch web pages or save files.

**Why It’s Great**: It’s simple to make, and it gets you started with useful tools right away!

### What If I Don’t Know How to Make a Config File?
No worries! Copy the example from [installation.md](installation.md)—it’s ready to use. Just change a few paths to match your computer (we explain how), and you’re good to go. If you’re stuck, ask us in [discussions](https://github.com/Techiral/OmniMind/discussions)!

**Why It’s Great**: You don’t need to figure it out alone—it’s all laid out for you!

## Using OmniMind Questions

### How Do I Start Using It?
After installing (see [installation.md](installation.md)), run this in a Python file:
```python
from omnimind import OmniMind

agent = OmniMind(config_path="path/to/my_config.json")
agent.run()
```
Type questions like “What’s on example.com?”—it’s that easy! Check [usage.md](usage.md) for more ideas.

**Why It’s Great**: Takes just a minute to start chatting with AI and MCP helpers!

### What Can I Do with OmniMind?
Lots! With the default servers (Fetch, Memory, Filesystem), try things like:
- “Summarize https://example.com” (web info).
- “Remember my favorite color is blue” (save stuff).
- “List files in my directory” (file tasks).
Add your own servers for even more—see [usage.md](usage.md)!

**Why It’s Great**: It’s flexible and fun—do whatever you want with it!

### What If I Get an Error?
Since OmniMind is still growing, errors can happen—like a server not connecting or a typo in your config. Here’s what to do:
- **Check Your API Key**: Make sure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set (see [installation.md](installation.md)).
- **Look at Your Config**: Double-check paths in `my_config.json` match your computer.
- **Try Again**: Sometimes it’s a quick glitch—run it again.
- **Ask Us**: Post the error in [discussions](https://github.com/Techiral/OmniMind/discussions) or email [techiralthefuture@gmail.com](mailto:techiralthefuture@gmail.com)—we’ll help fast!

**Why It’s Great**: Errors aren’t a big deal—we’ve got solutions, and you’re helping us make it better!

### Do I Need Coding Skills?
Not at all! Copy the examples from [usage.md](usage.md), and you’re set. If you can type and follow steps, you can use OmniMind. For coders, there’s more to explore, but beginners can start just as easily.

**Why It’s Great**: It’s friendly for all—no skills needed to have fun with MCP and AI!

### What If a Server Doesn’t Work?
If a server (like Memory or Filesystem) fails, it might need Node.js—download it free from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (takes a minute). Or, check your config paths. If it’s still tricky, tell us in [discussions](https://github.com/Techiral/OmniMind/discussions)—we’ll sort it out!

**Why It’s Great**: Quick fixes mean you’re never stuck, and we’re here to help!

## Troubleshooting

### Why Isn’t It Working?
If OmniMind doesn’t start:
- **API Key Missing**: Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (see [installation.md](installation.md)).
- **Config Wrong**: Check paths in `my_config.json`—they need to match your folders.
- **Python Issue**: Type `python --version` (or `python3 --version`)—if it fails, reinstall Python.
- **Still Stuck?**: Share the error in [discussions](https://github.com/Techiral/OmniMind/discussions)—we’ll fix it together!

**Why It’s Great**: Every problem has an answer, and we’re here to make it right!

### What If It Crashes?
OmniMind is still improving, so a crash might happen. Restart it, check your config, and let us know in [discussions](https://github.com/Techiral/OmniMind/discussions). It’s rare, and we’re working to make it super smooth!

**Why It’s Great**: You’re helping us grow, and it’s free to try again—no harm done!
